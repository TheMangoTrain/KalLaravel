Eloquent model and migration






Your task is to create an algorithm to take incoming orders and populate printing sheets.

More info:
- Sheets can be considered as a 10 unit by 15 unit grid
- Products come in sizes [ 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x2, 2x5 ]
- 1x1 -> means 1 grid unit by 1 grid unit

Constraints:
- Must use Laravel and Eloquent to develop algorithm
- Write your own migrations and seeders. (SQL Dump example provided but not importable)
- Orders must have all of their items on the same print sheet
- Orders can have any number of items with any number of quantity
- Must be able to track placement of products on the sheets

Generate 50 sheets of test data
- Bonus: Solutions that present the least amount of wasted space on sheets
- Bonus: Test coverage of algorithm

Example Data:

- Product 1 - Size 1x1
- Product 2 - Size 2x2
- Product 3 - Size 3x3
- Product 4 - Size 1x1
- Product 5 - Size 4x4
- Product 6 - Size 5x2
- Product 7 - Size 2x5

- Order 1
	- Product 1 - Quantity 2
	- Product 3 - Quantity 1
	- Product 6 - Quantity 1
	- Product 7 - Quantity 3
